Exercise 1: Create a string, number, list, and boolean, each stored in their own variable.

my_string = "Hello"
my_number = 42
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_boolean = True

Exercise 2: Use an index to grab the first 3 letters in your string, store that in a variable. 

first_three_letters = my_string[:3]

Exercise 3: Use an index to grab the first element from your list.

first_element_of_list = my_list[0]


Exercise 4: Create a new number variable that adds 10 to your original number.

new_number = my_number + 10

Exercise 5: Use an index to get the last element in your list.

last_element_of_list = my_list[-1]


Exercise 6: Use split to transform the following string into a list.
	names = 'harry,alex,susie,jared,gail,conner'

names = 'harry,alex,susie,jared,gail,conner'
names_list = names.split(',')

Exercise 7: Get the first word from your string using indexes. Use the upper function to transform the letters into uppercase. 
Create a new string that takes the uppercase word and the rest of the original string.

first_word = names[:5].upper()
rest_of_string = names[6:]
new_string = first_word + rest_of_string

Exercise 8: Use string interpolation to print out a sentence that contains your number variable.

print(f"The number variable is: {my_number}")

Exercise 9: Print “hello world”.

print("Hello world")
